[![CI](https://github.com/FilipMalczak/recursive_import/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FilipMalczak/recursive-import/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/recursive-import.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/recursive-import)

Trivial library that will import the whole module tree.

Main use case for this library is importing everything in given package. Simplest exaple are
decorators that register stuff for CI, a bit like annotation scanning in Java.

> Requires python 3.5+, because of `typing`. Besides that, there are no dependencies.

> System-independent. Tested on CPython 3.9-3.12 (to simplify CI), but its really trivial. 

The whole API is best documented by docstrings:

```python
def package_root(pkg: ModuleType) -> str:
    """
    Find out where is the root directory holding code for specified package or module.
    :param pkg: package to be located.
    :raise ValueError: if the argument is a module and not a package
    :return: absolute path to the directory holding the `__init__` file of the package
    """
    (...)

def current_project_root() -> str:
    """
    Find out where is the root directory holding code for currently running app.
    By "currently running app" we mean the module that is present as `__main__`.
    :return: absolute path to the directory holding the module that is `__main__`
    """
    (...)

def import_package_recursively(root_package: str) -> None:
    """
    Will import the package specified by name and all its subpackages and submodules recursively.
    Order is: each subpackage or submodule of the package, then recurse in that same order.
    :param root_package: name of the package to be scanned. If that's already a subpackage, its parent packages
        will get imported by default (because that's how python works)
    """
    (...)
```

Reading [the test suite](./test/test_recursive_import_from_root.py) is gonna be useful too, in case of uncertainty.
